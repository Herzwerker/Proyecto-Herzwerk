# Proyecto-Herzwerk

This project attemps to creat a web page with lyrics translations from German to Spanish of metal German Bands
In the first stage of the project the lyrics of the bands Megaherz and Eisbrecher have been completely translated into Spanish
The translations have been made by a human (me) using the Pons translation dictionary and the German-German dictionary Duden. 

Due to my lack of expertice in web developing the page is only on HTML5 and CSS3. 
At the moment (18/11/2019/ I'm trying to boost the page adding some javascripts, that can make the page more interactive.
